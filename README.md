# RIPL VM: RPN-based Interpretive Programming Language Virtual Machine

## Intro

This is a small demo project to demonstrate what goes into a Virtual Machine. I am not doing extensive error checking as I want to highlight the concepts and not drown out the code in error checking code.

If you are interested in this project I highly encourage you to take a look at my other related project named RPN-Script [here]().

## Outro

Please let me know what you think of the project.
